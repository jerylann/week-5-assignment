## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
weather <- data.frame(
  outlook = c("sunny", "sunny", "overcast"),
  temperature = c(85, 80, 83),
  humidity = c(85, 90, 86),
  windy = c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE),
  play = c("no", "no", "yes")
)

# Median: the middle value of the data (used if there is an outlier that can skew the mean)

# Mean: the average length of the sepals and petals

# 3rd Qu.: is the upper half of data; lengths greater than the median but less than the maximum/ longest lengths

# Max: the maximum length, the longest sepal and petal.
